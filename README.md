# 🖼️🎥 Image and Video Processing 
Image and video processing course @ USI - Universita' della Svizzera Italiana

Welcome to my repository for the **Image and Video Processing** exercises! 🚀

We had two choices to complete the exercises:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🧮 **MATLAB**

I decided to implement **all solutions in Python** 🐍✨ because it's the language I'm more familiar with.  
However, you will still find **empty MATLAB templates** 🧮 inside each directory — left there intentionally, just in case anyone needs to implement them later! 📂✅
